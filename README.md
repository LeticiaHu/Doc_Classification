# Doc_Classification


## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Access

This project uses the [Financial Document Classification dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swatigupta555/financial-document-classification), originally hosted on Kaggle.

Due to its large size (~9.64 GB), the full dataset is not included in this repository. Instead, a **smaller sample dataset** is provided for quick testing and deployment.

- `df_small.csv` â€“ Original dataset sample
- `sample_data.zip` â€“ a compressed folder of example images (100â€“250 per class)
